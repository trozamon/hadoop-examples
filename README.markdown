# Hadoop Examples
This repository contains some example Hadoop jobs to demonstrate how to test
and package them. In the words of Kent Beck:

> If a feature doesn't have a test, it doesn't exist

## CodeTokenizer
CodeTokenizer reads input source code, tokenizes it, and reports the counts of
all the tokens.

## MoabLicenseInfo
MoabLicenseInfo can scan Moab (an HPC scheduler from Adaptive Computing) logs
to determine software license usage statistics.

## Hadoop Version
This code is tested against a CDH 5.3.2 cluster.
